/* You are tasked with creating a banking system in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
concepts. The system should track the total number of bank accounts created across all customers
and include logic to identify high-value customers based on their account balance.
Requirements:
1. Create a class BankAccount with the following:
o A _________data member to store the total number of accounts.
o A _________data member MIN_HIGH_VALUE that stores the minimum balance
required to be considered a high-value account (e.g., $1000).
o A ________data member to store the account number. (auto generated)
o A ________ data member to store the account balance.
o A constructor to initialize the account with an initial balance and assign a unique
account number by incrementing the static member.
o A ________member function getTotalAccounts() to return the total number of
accounts created.
o A ________member function deposit() to deposit money into the account.
o A _______member function withdraw() to withdraw money from the account (but
only if sufficient balance is available).
o A _______member function display() to display account details (account number and
balance).
o Logic-building function: A _______member function isHighValueAccount() that
returns true if the account balance is greater than or equal to MIN_HIGH_VALUE,
otherwise returns false.
2. Write a second class, Bank, that:
o Contains a _______ array of BankAccount objects.
o Has a ________function addAccount() to create new BankAccount objects with a
provided initial balance.
o Implements a _______ function displayHighValueAccounts() that iterates through all
accounts and displays details of high-value accounts (those where
isHighValueAccount() returns true).
3. Implement logic in the main function to:
o Create at least 5 bank accounts with varying balances using the Bank class.
o Deposit and withdraw from some accounts.
o Display the details of all accounts.
o Use the displayHighValueAccounts() function to show which accounts qualify as highvalue.
o Display the total number of accounts created using the static function.
Note: Here ______: chooses the best-fit specifier and storage class: private/public/static/nonstatic/const
